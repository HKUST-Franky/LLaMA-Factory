The relationship between these variables is represented by the equation V1/T1=V2/T2. where V1and T1are the initial volume and temperature respectively, while V2and T2are the final volume and temperature respectively of a sample of gas brought from an initial state (V1,T 1)to some other state (V 2, T 2).
