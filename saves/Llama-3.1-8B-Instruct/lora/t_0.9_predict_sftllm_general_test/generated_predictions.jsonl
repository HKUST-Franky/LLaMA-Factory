Since there are two triangular ends, the total area is 2 * 54 = 108 square meters.\n\nNow, let's figure out the sides. First, we need the slant height of the prism. Since it's a right triangular prism, we can use the Pythagorean theorem, which gives us√(9^2 + 12^2) = 15 meters. \n\nThere are three rectangular sides. Each has an area of length * width. However, seems we are not provided the length of the prism, let's call it 'l'. \n\nSo, the total surface area is 2 * area of triangle + 3 * area of rectangle = 108 + 3 * (l * 15).

The total surface area is the sum of the areas of the two triangular bases and the three rectangular faces. \n\nFirst, let's calculate the area of the two triangular bases. The area of a triangle is given by the formula: Area = 0.5 * base * height. Since the base of the triangular prism is nine meters long, the area of each base is 0.5 * 9 * 12 = 54 square meters. Since there are two bases, the total area of the bases is 2 * 54 = 108 square meters.\n\nNext, let's calculate the area of the three rectangular faces. The area of a rectangle is given by the formula: Area = length * width. Since the height of the prism is twelve meters, the length of each rectangular face is 9 meters. The width of each rectangular face is 12 meters. Therefore, the area of each rectangular face is 9 * 12 = 108 square meters. Since there are three rectangular faces, the total area of the rectangular faces is 3 * 108 = 324 square meters.\n\nFinally, we can calculate the total surface area of the triangular prism by adding the total area of the bases and the total area of the rectangular faces: Total Surface Area = 108 + 324 = 432 square meters."}

If there is no duplicate, the hare will reach the end of the array. Once the tortoise and the hare have met, the code resets the tortoise to the start of the array and continues to move both the tortoise and the hare through the array until they meet again.

If we make it through the entire loop without finding a character out of order, we can output 'Yes'. \n\nSo, for the string 'apple', we would start by comparing 'a' to nothing (since it's the first character). We then move on to 'p' and compare it to '", "predict": "Here is a Python function that will solve this problem. This function takes a string as input and returns 'Yes' if the string is in alphabetical order, 'No' otherwise.

If it finds a pair of characters that are out of order, it immediately returns 'No'. If it gets through the entire string without finding any out-of-order pairs, it returns 'Yes'."}
