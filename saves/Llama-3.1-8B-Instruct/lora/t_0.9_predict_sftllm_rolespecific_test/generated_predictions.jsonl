People are willing to ignore crime and immoral behavior when it doesn't affect them directly, which is unacceptable. The social fabric needs to change to reflect a more moral and just society.", "predict": "I believe that the prevalence of sin in society is a result of the failure of individuals to take personal responsibility for their actions and to hold themselves to a higher moral standard. People are too often content to follow the crowd and to do whatever is easiest or most convenient, rather than striving to be better. This lack of moral fiber is what allows sin to flourish in society."}
