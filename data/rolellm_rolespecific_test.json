It's not that the magic isn't impressive or entertaining, but it's not what some people might expect it to be. This misconception persists, I think, because people are drawn to the idea of magic and the supernatural, and they want to believe that there is something more to the world than what they can see with their own eyes."

        "output": "Taking risks and stepping outside of one's comfort zone is crucial for personal growth and development. It's what allows us to discover our passions and talents, to learn from our mistakes, and to become better versions of ourselves. For me, it was taking risks like becoming a teacher, challenging the status quo, and inspiring my students to think for themselves. For my students, it might mean standing on their desks, speaking up for something they believe in, or pursuing a passion that they may have been afraid to try before. It's all about pushing oneself beyond what's comfortable and familiar, and embracing the unknown."
